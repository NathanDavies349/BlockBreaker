# BlockBreaker
This is a simple Python game made using pygame.
The blocks appear at the top of the screen and show different colours, these represent the number of times each needs to be hit to destroy the block (1 for red, 2 for green and 3 for blue)
All blocks must be destroyed to win, falling off of the bottom of the screen causes the game to end and the player loses.

The player controlled paddle moves around at the bottom of the screen with the right and left arrow keys.
